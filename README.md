# Center_Pivot_Cloggins_Paper
Data and Python code for the analysis of CU under emitter clogging scenarios in center pivot irrigation systems.
This repository presents data collected from an experiment conducted in a center pivot (2.14 ha) located in Coimbra, state of Minas Gerais, Brazil, between April and October 2025.
If you wish to reproduce the simulations, you need to adapt them to the uniformity tests  in the center pivot of your analysis. It is important to edit, especially, the uniformity calculator to fit the number of collectors in your test.

Make good use of it. I will always be available to help.
